here are ideas for N4


- fantasy room with the door thats never been opened and the window thats never been seen through
  - sleeping on the wall becaue "there are no good sleeping positions"
  - bookshelves of translations of alice, prince, and hesse
    - interacting with it reads a line!! fun picking a fun line from each!!
  - fantasy computer rigs 8 )
  - midi console
  - workspace with solder fumes going out of the room into the black void
- characters OUTSIDE the fantasy room
  - the dogs
  - characterization of drunken mom
  - dad with endless books
  - gma characterization with weird ass requests 'lets go haul limbs'
- places to explore based on ALL the homes i've previously lived in
- other places to explore:
  - the XXX building that screams and kicks u out if u go in
- existential vibes
  - and options menu that denies censorship
    - and many text screens similar to "are u judging me for using comic sans?"
  - gaze of accountability
  - thrashing nervous system
  - social anxiety simulator, paralysis
  - willful ignorance
  - capitalistic dystopia?????
  - the failings of willpower
  - cringefest
  - world 1 and 2 (and "3")
  - the DE-INDIVUADILATION and creatiuve DISCOVERY, creativity HAPPENS TO YOU (passive)
  - intellectual selfcest
  - and of course more segments based on philosophical rants on my twitter
  - pompous conflict
  - u cant be urself without ppl hating u for it
  - u cant be urself without ppl hating THEMSELVES for it
- integrate dreams
  - paskett BRain dream yes
- RANDOM ALIASES!!!! AND RANDOM FLAVOR TEXT GENERATORS THAT MIX AND MATCH LANGUAGES!!!!!
- fancy room is the kernel of the 'mind force field' see u are actually trapped living in ur own mind and u never venture out of it, and u cant venture out of it without EXCITING ur emotions , u ee the ENTIRE CHARACTER OF THE INNER MIND STARTS WARPING as u change ur emotions.... u are NAVIGATING THE MAZE OF UR MIND... the shape CHANGES as u DO things which changes the the EMOTIONS which ultimately can weaken the force field and allow u to WAKE UP... u are in SLEEP PARALYSIS...! this is a very imotant and good idea
- create ur own tunes... dynamic tunes.... and it will be ur THEME and u will grow attached to it throughout the game
- subtle PHYSICS for taking out ur anger on OBJECTS n shit
- yes! music listening in the closet sessions
- my fantasy room ought to be modeled after my real room in my last house yes......
- saketboard ????? ikd
- screen darkening effect for "other rooms" which darkens it to just a shadow
