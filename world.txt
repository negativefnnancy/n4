your head "fantasy room":
this area is a HOUSE area
initially known as "???"
initially starts off with YOUR ROOM and connected to it is YOUR BATHROOM
when you finally are able to leave the room it goes down an abstract surreal pathway known as "OUTSIDE YOUR ROOM"
at the end of the surreal pathway is a main room conjoining the rest of the house!! with a couple upstairs bedroms, a long hallway forward to a balcony, and a stair case going downstairs
downstairs is the KITCHEN, the TV ROOM, and the STUDY, and the FOYER andanother bathroom

the sTUDY is where you encounter the DAD
the TV room is where you encounter the MOM
one of the bedrooms is where u encounter the GUITAR preosn
and kitchen is where u encounter the GMA cooking n asking u millions of stuff andh asking u to go haul limbs
the backyrd is where there are DOGS
FRIDGEY is conveniently in the kitchen hehe
when u look i nit i ts a FRIDGE BOT reference "the fridge contains _random stuff_"

u can go out on the balcony to see a VOID

dining room actually has a piano.... u can MAKE UR OWN TUNES here


YOUR room, will have a southern CLOSET... which acts as the JUKE BOX function, where you can listen to the sound track

there will be weird random floating text in the SURREAL BRIDGE between your room and the rest of the house

a computer in the house will have the options menu with the FAKE censorship option
also language settings are set here

the whole thing is a SOCIAL ANXIETY PUZZLE where you have to weaken your anxiety enough to allow you to go out the front door

normally when you niteract with it it says something like
"the front door. you've never been outside. you aren't feeling like it today."
and you can at any time check the front door to see how you are feeling about going outside

the dad character is someone you can ask advice from
and you get conflicting advice such as about raw willpower
the guitar person character is someone you enjoy the music but you are too afraid to talk to her


also on the exterior of the doorway leading to your house is your NEON SIGN : )

when you get courage enough to talk to the guitar person you can have convos
and also CRINGE FEST
actually maybe the dad character should be the gaze of accountability and the raw willpower both
the dad character talks abotu capitalism too
and also .... you want to showe the guitar person things but POMPOUS CONFLICT
and at the piano there is philosophy about CREATIVE DISCOVERY AND DE INDIVIDUALIZATION

the sleep spot on your wall allows you to pass time, it changes the time of day, and that includes the palette, cycles between the three
day -> "you napped until dusk"
dusk -> "you napped until night"
night -> "you woke up at noon"
and these different times of day have different scenarios in the house with the what the people are up to

also the SHOWER in the private bathroom!! you DONT TAKE SHOWERS! and if you MAKE YOURSELF, you feel icky
(whether you can depends on your feelings again)

this whole game is a PUZZLE, a big STATE MACHINE, the STATE consistes of your FEELINGS and the TIME OF DAY


also on the SURREAL BRIDGE
everytime you go there therell be something different, just easter eggy stuff
personal relevance
flying texts, random camios



and anyway, im thinking this whole game can be a 'short game' 
with the only world being this fantasy surreal house where you are stuck in your mind
so it can probably be NROM!
all INSDE

MAPS:
there are multiple MAPS, which are different arrangements of the home.. i think..
actually no thats a bad idea lol

there are two maps, upstairs and downstairs, oh, and private room is a map, and surreal bridge is a map, and balcony is a map, and backyard is a map
those are the maps

i think the name of this game should be 'NUTHOUSE'
its perfect lol

btw, 'dad' 'mom' 'gma' etc are just codenames, in the game there are no names, just descriptions
ccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc

in the kitchen there shall be MICROWAVE HORROR!!

also.... instead of there being one BIG GAME, with lots of CHAPTERS, it will be SEVERAL GAMES, multiple INSTALLMENTS
so this first game is the chapter of getting out of the mind force field...
"NUTHOUSE"
negative nancy's debut : )


i think there ought to be lilybot and lambdabot and tunebot somewhere lol
if nowhere else then the surreal bridge


also three should be a FOURTH cycle, the dREAM cycle, its also at night, but you encounter very STRANGE circumestances
